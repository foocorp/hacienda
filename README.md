# [We are bored in the city, there is no longer any Temple of the Sun. ](city.md)

---

* Things are very much at a planning stage right now, but this is the place for a future version of Libre.fm running on a new codebase (this project).

## Why now?

* Libre.fm is effectively a silo (other than Last.fm which it talks to, although federation with other instances has been possible for a _long_ time)
* Libre.fm has over 372,000 registered users and 291 million scrobbles.
* Libre.fm should be a more active citizen in federated social web.

## Why not improve GNU FM?

* GNU FM is built on 2009 era PHP frameworks and technology. We can probably keep going with it but we can probably encourage more developers using modern web frameworks
* GNU FM relies on frameworks and libraries that are no longer being maintained
* GNU project doesn't handle web applications well, is more focused on other pieces of free software
* A new project, free from the GNU project ownership will give us new opportunities 

## What won't change

* The license -- GNU AGPL 3.0 or later

## Get involved
